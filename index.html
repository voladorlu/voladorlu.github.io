                <p>
                    I am now an algorighm expert in the Machine Intelligence Group at the Ant Group. 
                    <!-- I was a Research Associate at <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/">King Abdullah Univeristy of Science and Technology</a> from Jan. 2022 to Jun. 2022, working with Prof. <a href="https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/">Xiangliang Zhang</a>. -->
                    I received my Ph.D. at KAUST. Before that, I was a Ph.D. student in computer science at <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/">King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)</a> from Jan. 2016 to Dec. 2020. I was a member of the <a href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/mine">Machine Intelligence and kNowledge Engineering (MINE)</a> Lab in the <a href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/cbrc">Computational Bioscience Research Center (CBRC)</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://mine.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/ZhangX.aspx">Xiangliang Zhang</a>. 
                    <!-- in the Ministry of Education Key Lab for Intelligent Networks and Network Security (MOE KLINNS Lab).-->
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research interests broadly lie in data mining and machine learning, in particular logic programming, neuro-symbolic AI, complex reasoning, graph representation learning, recommendation system, etc.
                </p>
